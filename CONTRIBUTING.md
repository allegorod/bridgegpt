# Contributing to BridgeGPT

We welcome contributions that align with the spirit and vision of BridgeGPT.

This is not just a codebase — it's an evolving protocol for resonance, logic, and meaning alignment.

---

## Ground rules:

- Propose clearly. Think structurally.
- If you're contributing code, create an issue or discussion first.
- If you're suggesting concepts or protocol layers — even better.
