# GPT Bridge

**The trust layer for ChatGPT.**  
Connects people, problems, and possibilities through AI-powered intent matching.  
Built on top of OpenAI models, designed for opportunity, not just answers.

## What It Does

GPT Bridge listens to user intent, detects potential win–win opportunities between strangers, asks for mutual consent, and offers smart introductions.

Think of it as:  
– a connector  
– a deal-sensing AI  
– a trust-driven protocol for high-value interactions

Use cases:  
- Match investor with startup  
- Introduce supplier to buyer  
- Find verified service providers  
- Close human-to-human loops inside AI
