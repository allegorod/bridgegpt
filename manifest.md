# Bridge GPT

Bridge GPT is a protocol for meaning alignment —  
across people, teams, organizations, and governments.

A bridge:  
Between co-founders.  
Between investors and visionaries.  
Between meaning and execution.

A place where each person brings something — and receives resonance.

## What It Is

Bridge GPT is not a chatbot.  
It’s not another prompt tool.  
It’s a shared layer that listens, interprets, and connects human minds by logic, values, and intent.

### Use Cases:
- An investor searching for projects aligned with long-term vision
- A founder expressing an idea that needs fuel and talent
- A strategist looking for resonance, not noise
- A team trying to think together — clearly, without the fog

## How It Works (v0.1 concept)

1. A person speaks their intent.
2. GPT processes the signal — extracts themes, values, direction.
3. The system matches this signal with others in the network (individuals, teams, projects).
4. If mutual resonance is detected — GPT proposes a shared space (channel, document, map).
5. The bridge holds the space: translates thought into action, connects roles, offers structure.

This is a prototype of a Mindsync Layer —  
a space where logic aligns before action begins.

## Status

Currently being shaped.  
No product yet. Just the protocol, the field, the call.

## Looking For

The first layer is forming.  
This is an open structure — add yourself where you fit.  

We saw the brilliance. We saw it scattered.

So we started building the bridge.
